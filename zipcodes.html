                <p>What part of Los Angeles saw the most tickets? To find this out the dataset was grouped by zipcode a count call, for the total number of tickets written. A count call on fines for each zipcode was then performed.
                </p>
                <p>The average number of tickets distributed is represented by the green horizontal line across the graph. It turns out most tickets in LA are written in the zipcode 90034, which covers three neighborhoods just outside of downtown LA:
                </p>
                <p>Palms, Art District, and part of the Castle Heights neighborhood. An interesting idea for someone to do in addition would be to overlay this map with a census dataset taking a look at the demographics of each area and the fines given.

                    <p>Another naturally curious question one might have when looking at this dataset is the total amount of fines handed out. In this case the dataset was grouped by zipcode. A sum call on fines for each zipcode was then performed.
                    </p>
                    <p>As one might expect judging by the previous bar graph the highest grossing total fines were handed out in the 90034 zipcode. </p>
                    <p>The second highest grossing zipcode is 90045 which includes The Los Angeles LAX International airport. Given more time the project group hoped to further drill into the data to explore what kind of violations might more frequently
                        occur at a unique location such as the airport.

                        <p>To better illustrate the relationship of citations and where they happen, a heatmap was used. A map of Los Angeles defined by a red boundary is overlayed with bubbles radiating on a scale to show the concentration of tickets given
                            out at that location.</p>
                        <p>With a little more time on the project the group had hoped to similarly overlay onto the map a visual illustration of the types of violations and where they most happen at.</p>
